TODO:

Add filters box

pop out box?

add button on shop page

sort by price (high to low), range of price, category -> have to change the page name (more than 1 segment means just shoes?)

just simplify? if using filters, then just say its Filtered shoes (SoleGood Shoe Discovery) or smth if not default is ("popularity" -> maybe like popular men's shoes etc)
